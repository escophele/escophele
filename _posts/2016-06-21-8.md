title: The End of the Road

No progress on the actual manuscript, still, but there is no despair, only grim determination lol.

I've been slowly going to bed earlier and getting up earlier to try to carve out some time in the morning to write. I realize the futility of trying to write at night before bed. I managed to do it before, but it sucked every time. Writing, or any sort of focused task, is the last thing I want to do after a long day and I can't imagine sticking to that sort of schedule.

Ideally, I want to wake up at 6, and write for two hours before work. I've been getting up at 7:30 now and getting about 45 minutes in. Getting there, I suppose. This requires going to sleep at 10, which I would have thought impossible even a year ago. I was a committed night owl and loved staying up. I'm probably just getting old.

I'm trying to organize my plot in a spreadsheet. It sort of worked in the beginning. It was nice seeing so much information all in one glancable view. I had chapters on the left and characters across the top. I could easily see what characters are involved in a chapter and also when they popped in or out of the story.

But then it was too much information all at once. The thing is, my outline isn't final  yet, and I still need to move things around. I learned soon enough that there was more friction in swapping rows and columns around a spreadsheet than it was to move sentences in a word doc. So, everything is very much still in flux. I have no process. Fun though.
