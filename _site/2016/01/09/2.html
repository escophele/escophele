<p>I have a first draft done. It’s been done for a while now actually. Getting it to the second draft is hella hard, and it’s where I’ve been stuck.</p>

<p>The first draft is writing down what happens, so that’s pretty straightforward and goes by fast. It also has the thrill of a new story to push it along. The second draft though, is about filling in how and why things happen. I have to be accountable here.</p>

<p>And the third draft—it’s everything. It’s where I set myself apart, go all. It’s where I <em>make babies</em>.</p>
