         <p>With luck I can finish the first book by the middle of the year, and the second book by the end of the year. Two books per year sounds like a nice pace.</p>

<p>I’m getting way ahead of myself. I’ve planned this out to ultimately have three big volumes, each comprising five books. The second volume has the scene that sparked the whole story and is what I’m writing toward all this time. I’ve had that in my head since 2008, crazy. I just. need. to. get there—</p>

         <p>I’ve got a big first chunk into second draft, whoo. I nailed down and committed to some of the iffier details I had up in the air in the first draft.</p>

<p>I expect I would have more exciting updates once I actually finish the book. These little milestones are invigorating for me personally though.</p>

<p>I work on the book Monday to Thursday, in the few hours before midnight, and all day Sunday if I could manage it—Sunday is the worst day of the week and I fight it by working nonstop.</p>

         <p>I have a first draft done. It’s been done for a while now actually. Getting it to the second draft is hella hard, and it’s where I’ve been stuck.</p>

<p>The first draft is writing down what happens, so that’s pretty straightforward and goes by fast. It also has the thrill of a new story to push it along. The second draft though, is about filling in how and why things happen. I have to be accountable here.</p>

<p>And the third draft—it’s everything. It’s where I set myself apart, go all. It’s where I <em>make babies</em>.</p>

         <p>I’m going to write a book! And I’m going to write about it here.</p>

<p>The story is about a treasure hunt.</p>
