      Monica Lewinksy's TED talk
   </a>
</p>
<p>I haven't thought about her for years. And I don't think I even thought about her during the actual scandal (twenty years ago!)&mdash;not in a primary way&mdash;only really through cultural references and memes.</p>
<p>So this talk was interesting in that it was first time I've really looked at her and heard her speak. I recognized her face, through, again, that cultural osmosis, but was simultaneously seeing her for the first time.</p>
<p>I liked her talk. It was substantial and she had real things to say. I never understood or thought much about cyberbullying, which sounds so lame, like if a bully flunks out of real bullying school so they have to do it online during nights or weekends. Another stupid thing kids do these days. But the more I listened, the more sympathetic I got and had to acknowledge my human side and learned to curb myself from delighting in making fun of the stupid kids these days.</p>
