I have a first draft done. It's been done for a while now actually. Getting it to the second draft is hella hard, and it's where I've been stuck. 

The first draft is writing down what happens, so that's pretty straightforward and goes by fast. It also has the thrill of a new story to push it along. The second draft though, is about filling in how and why things happen. I have to be accountable here.

And the third draft&mdash;it's everything. It's where I set myself apart, go all. It's where I *make babies*.
