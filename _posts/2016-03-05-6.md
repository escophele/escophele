Finishing Book 1 by the middle of the year is indeed way too optimistic. I'm super slow apparently. My true writing speed is about 100 words per hour. These are the final edited words. First draft words go much faster, of course, but I pay for it when I edit.

That has been my effective rate since forever, all through essay-writing in high school and college. I never used to do drafts and just write all the way through in one sitting, editing as I go. It took a lot of time and all-nighters, but I was done when I reached the end.

I didn't think it'll apply to fiction. I can't grind through 50,000 words the same way I did through 5,000, right? It might be that I can't escape my natural pace or method.

However slow, I still made progress the past month. Bumping the bar up to 35%. About 17,000 words of Draft 2 in the bank. That's based off a final length of 50,000, which I really want the book to hit at the end. Anything less seems like a cop-out and I can't conscionably charge full price.

Forecast: I plan to finish Part 3 by the end of the month, Part 4 end of April, and Part 5 (and so Draft 2) by end of May. I have no idea how long a deep Draft 3 will take. I guess I'll find out!
