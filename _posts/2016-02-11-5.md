Part 2 Draft 2 done! Part 1 and Part 2 have stuck pretty close to their Draft 1 counterparts in terms of word count so far. If the rest of the book follows suit, Book 1 will hover somewhere between 30k and 40k. I had expected Draft 2 to be longer than Draft 1, which was 30k, from all the brief sketches and summarizing I did. I realized during this draft that I cut out as many words as I put in--often cutting more. It might just be that I've gone over the first parts so often already that they're much cleaner and don't require as much handling.

Three more Parts to go before I dive deep into Draft 3. This is a slog.
