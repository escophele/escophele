I've got a big first chunk into second draft, whoo. I nailed down and committed to some of the iffier details I had up in the air in the first draft.

I expect I would have more exciting updates once I actually finish the book. These little milestones are invigorating for me personally though.

I work on the book Monday to Thursday, in the few hours before midnight, and all day Sunday if I could manage it---Sunday is the worst day of the week and I fight it by working nonstop.
