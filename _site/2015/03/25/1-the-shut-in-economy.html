      The Shut-In Economy
   </a>
</p>
<p>Whenever I read an article about tech workers and millenials, I get this awful taste in my mouth. There doesn't seem to be anything nice to say about them. At all. There's just so much more dirt&mdash;it's too easy. Even the words "tech workers" and "millenials" are skewing negatively in connotation.</p>
<p>I thought this article was no exception. I didn't think I was going to make it through the first paragraph, much less the entire thing. When describing the residents of an apartment building: "Ubers, Squares, and a few Twitters." Gag. I don't want to be part of the reality they're making.</p>
<p>But then, the most interesting part of the article came up: the delivery people who bring all the groceries and take-out and laundry and packages. Now they are the ones I want to read more about. "They end up asking each other which apps they work for." Such a great line.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this article isn't about them. The delivery people get a few brief mentions before the author goes back to the boring busy tech people and their problems no one cares about.</p>
