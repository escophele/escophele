Things have been horrible. Writing sucks. I went as far as I could through the second draft while delaying a decision on a major detail and I can't ignore it any longer. The book can't move forward if I don't figure this out.

I've been taking steps back and wrestling with the outline from a higher level. What scenes do I really want to write and care about? I don't want to spend most of my time--neither would the reader--trudging through the barrens between the awesome scenes. No filler.

I'm going to spend twenty years on this thing omg.
