<p>I have a first draft. I’ve had it for a while now. Getting it to the second draft is hella hard, and it’s where I’ve been stuck.</p>

<p>The first draft is writing down what happens, so that’s pretty straightforward and goes by fast. It also has the thrill of a new story to push it along. The second draft though, is about filling in how and why things happen. I have to be accountable here.</p>

<p>The third draft is everything. It’s where I have to set myself apart, go all, where I have to fucking <em>make babies</em>.</p>
