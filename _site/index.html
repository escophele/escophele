    <p>No progress on the actual manuscript, still, but there is no despair, only grim determination lol.</p>

<p>I’ve been slowly going to bed earlier and getting up earlier to try to carve out some time in the morning to write. I realize the futility of trying to write at night before bed. I managed to do it before, but it sucked every time. Writing, or any sort of focused task, is the last thing I want to do after a long day and I can’t imagine sticking to that sort of schedule.</p>

<p>Ideally, I want to wake up at 6, and write for two hours before work. I’ve been getting up at 7:30 now and getting about 45 minutes in. Getting there, I suppose. This requires going to sleep at 10, which I would have thought impossible even a year ago. I was a committed night owl and loved staying up. I’m probably just getting old.</p>

<p>I’m trying to organize my plot in a spreadsheet. It sort of worked in the beginning. It was nice seeing so much information all in one glancable view. I had chapters on the left and characters across the top. I could easily see what characters are involved in a chapter and also when they popped in or out of the story.</p>

<p>But then it was too much information all at once. The thing is, my outline isn’t final  yet, and I still need to move things around. I learned soon enough that there was more friction in swapping rows and columns around a spreadsheet than it was to move sentences in a word doc. So, everything is very much still in flux. I have no process. Fun though.</p>

    <p>Things have been horrible. Writing sucks. I went as far as I could through the second draft while delaying a decision on a major detail and I can’t ignore it any longer. The book can’t move forward if I don’t figure this out.</p>

<p>I’ve been taking steps back and wrestling with the outline from a higher level. What scenes do I really want to write and care about? I don’t want to spend most of my time–neither would the reader–trudging through the barrens between the awesome scenes. No filler.</p>

<p>I’m going to spend twenty years on this thing omg.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/03/05/" title="Permalink">6</a></h2>

    <p>Finishing Book 1 by the middle of the year is indeed way too optimistic. I’m super slow apparently. My true writing speed is about 100 words per hour. These are the final edited words. First draft words go much faster, of course, but I pay for it when I edit.</p>

<p>That has been my effective rate since forever, all through essay-writing in high school and college. I never used to do drafts and just write all the way through in one sitting, editing as I go. It took a lot of time and all-nighters, but I was done when I reached the end.</p>

<p>I didn’t think it’ll apply to fiction. I can’t grind through 50,000 words the same way I did through 5,000, right? It might be that I can’t escape my natural pace or method.</p>

<p>However slow, I still made progress the past month. Bumping the bar up to 35%. About 17,000 words of Draft 2 in the bank. That’s based off a final length of 50,000, which I really want the book to hit at the end. Anything less seems like a cop-out and I can’t conscionably charge full price.</p>

<p>Forecast: I plan to finish Part 3 by the end of the month, Part 4 end of April, and Part 5 (and so Draft 2) by end of May. I have no idea how long a deep Draft 3 will take. I guess I’ll find out!</p>

    <p>Part 2 Draft 2 done! Part 1 and Part 2 have stuck pretty close to their Draft 1 counterparts in terms of word count so far. If the rest of the book follows suit, Book 1 will hover somewhere between 30k and 40k. I had expected Draft 2 to be longer than Draft 1, which was 30k, from all the brief sketches and summarizing I did. I realized during this draft that I cut out as many words as I put in–often cutting more. It might just be that I’ve gone over the first parts so often already that they’re much cleaner and don’t require as much handling.</p>

<p>Three more Parts to go before I dive deep into Draft 3. This is a slog.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/01/30/" title="Permalink">4</a></h2>

    <p>With luck I can finish the first book by the middle of the year, and the second book by the end of the year. Two books per year sounds like a nice pace.</p>

<p>I’m getting way ahead of myself. I’ve planned this out to ultimately have three big volumes, each comprising five books. The second volume has the scene that sparked the whole story and is what I’m writing toward all this time. I’ve had that in my head since 2008, crazy. I just. need. to. get there—</p>
